## Disclaimer
The repository and code was made in relation to my studies. A large part of the code was never meant to be shown, and the only deliverable was the products of the code. Therefore, such code may be messy, and commenting and documenting was done for my own benefit and may therefore be informal (even vulgar), or non-existant. Refining this after the fact would not be true to the process of how I write code for assignments in the university.
